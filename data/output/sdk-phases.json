The fn/controller implenmting these callback use the data for 2 things:  1. uses attributes of the KRM for further processing later on  2. provide feedback on readiness through the error- Afterwards if the readiness gate is true the PopulateOwnResourcesFn is called if defined by the fn/controller.  - the resources returned are used as    - child resource within the for instance    - the sdk performs a diff and brings the actual state in line with the desired state- In the final phase when readiness is determined, the sdk executes the GenerateResourceFn. The result is the final step and the data is added/updated in the resourceList of the kpt packageEach function/controller has to implement GenerateResourceFn. Only the functions/controller having own resource have to implement PopulateOwnResourcesFn."
